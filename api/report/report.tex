\section{Preliminary Functional and Non-Functional Requirements}
\fpar \textbf{SPARK note}: For the first Spark request we use a complex SQL query, for the second request we use a graph approach, which fix very nicely to the Spark capabilities.
  
  \subsection{Functional}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Any person should be able to sign/log in with a new account.
      \item Any person should be able to search for a username

      \item User should be able to ask for suggestions.
      \item Admin should be able to add and remove content from the library.
      \item \textbf{(Spark)} User should be able to see who's the best director and the worker with most connection with other workers.
    \end{itemize}

  \subsection{Non-Functional}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Browsing Items shouldn't take more than $1.5$ seconds to load.
      \item Searching shouldn't take more than $1.5$ seconds loading the response.
      \item Marking Item as seen or liked shouldn't take loading time on Users' end.
      \item Suggestions shouldn't take more than $5$ seconds.
      \item Data stored in cache shouldn't affect the system.
      \item Adding and Removing Items should persist on the database.
      \item \textbf{Spark} request should not return error.
      \item \textbf{Spark} should and take less than $10$ minutes.
    \end{itemize}
