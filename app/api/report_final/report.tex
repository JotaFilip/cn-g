\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:motivation}
\fpar For our project we were thinking about an API that could help us decide which shows to watch next, by marking shows as viewed and/or liked.
\par Because we can watch more than just movies, like anime, we wanted to use more than one dataset. Both animes and movies can have a lot in common not only with each other but also with books, so we also decided to use a book dataset.
\par So we have three datasets, and we can effortlessly search through any of them, mark them as seen or liked, and get suggestions. Having very similar categories in every single one of them.
\par For the suggestions our idea was making a recommendation list having in mind the item's rating and user's likes and views, which would indicate to us which categories the user prefers.
\par So it makes sense to call our API “Seen”.

\section{Dataset characterization}
\label{sec:dataset}
  \subsection{Dataset 1 — IMDB}
  \label{sec:movies}
  \fpar This data set provides a lot of information about movies and shows that can be seen in \href{https://www.imdb.com}{IMDB}.
  \par We downloaded the dataset from the \href{https://www.kaggle.com/ashirwadsangwan/imdb-dataset}{Kaggle} website, updated one year ago.
  \par From the whole data this where the columns that were important to us:
  \begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{l|l}
      Columns & Example                     \\ \hline
      id      & 606e2683b3fff1da8a207ae9    \\
      name    & The Arrival of a Train      \\
      category& [Action,Documentary,Short]  \\
      rating  & 7.4                         \\
      type    & short
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Movie example in our database}
    \label{table:movie}
  \end{table}

  \subsection{Dataset 2 — MyAnimeList}
  \label{sec:animes}
  \fpar For the second data set we got it from \href{https://www.kaggle.com/azathoth42/myanimelist}{Kaggle}, about the \href{https://myanimelist.net/}{MyAnimeList} website.
  \par This data not only has a lot of anime content but also user information, but because we want to connect with the other datasets doesn't make sense to use that data. Meaning we used these columns:
  \begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{l|l}
      Columns & Example                       \\ \hline
      id      & 606e252aebddc73ebfb15507      \\
      name    & Shakugan no Shana: Season II  \\
      category& [Action,Drama,Fantasy,Romance,School,Supernatural]  \\
      rating  & 7.72                          \\
      imageUrl& https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/anime/10/18669.jpg
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Anime example in our database}
    \label{table:anime}
  \end{table}

  \subsection{Dataset 3 — GoodReads}
  \label{sec:books}
  \fpar At last, this data set represents books from the \href{https://www.goodreads.com/}{GoodReads} website, also downloaded from \href{https://www.kaggle.com/meetnaren/goodreads-best-books}{Kaggle}.
  \par The helpful data from this data set, to be able to use with animes and movies, is its categories and rating:
  \begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{l|l}
      Columns & Example                       \\ \hline
      id      & 606e25ad5e927a606f534284      \\
      name    & Of Mice and Men               \\
      description & The compelling story of two outsiders [...]           \\
      category& [Classics,Fiction,Academic,School,Literature,Historical]  \\
      rating  & 7.7                           \\
      imageUrl& https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1511302904l/890.jpg
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Book example in our database}
    \label{table:book}
  \end{table}

\section{Use cases}
\label{sec:cases}
\fpar We have 3 types of Users: an Admin, which is a logged-in user with special permissions, a Regular user, which is a logged-in user, and a not logged-in user that we call Any.
\begin{table}[H]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{c|c|l}

\section{Architecture (application and technical)}
\label{sec:architecture}
% say hwo to took care of item's id that can have duplicates (even if only being a small chance)
  \subsection{Diagram}
  \begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ CloudNativeAppArchitecture.png }
    \caption{Project's architecture.}
    \label{img:architecture}
  \end{figure}

  \subsection{Application}
    \subsubsection{Client}
    \fpar The Client should be able to access our API on his browser:
    \begin{center}
      \url{https://recommendations.sytes.net}
    \end{center}
    \par The Swagger provides a user interface to use and test our calls by adding "/ui" to the end of the url above.

    \subsubsection{Server}
    \fpar In total there are 7 different microservices working at the same time. Every single one runs on the Google Cloud, inside the same cluster but different dockers.
    \par Our reasoning was having an entrance microservice, which would redirect the request to the microservice responsible for that type of request, for example when sending a request for a page in our library, the API Gateway receives that request and sends it to the Library Service, where he has the responsibility of ask for Item to the Book, IMDB and Anime Service, and them put them together in just one response, that response then is sent to the API Gateway, to be show to the Client.
    \par This API Gateway service also has the responsibility of transforming the REST requests from the Client to gRPC request that is used internally, between Services.
    \par We also have 5 services which are responsible for the database connection, meaning they are responsible to translate the request they receive to inserts, updates, removes or queries to the database.

    \subsubsection{Databases}
    \fpar Every database has a service that has the responsibility to access and manage it. While 3 of them are hosted by \href{https://www.mongodb.com/}{MongoDB} a NoSQL database, the last one is an SQL database hosted by Google Cloud.
    \par For the Items' databases (Books, Movies and Animes) we used a NoSQL database since we might change the format of our documents, meaning if we had an SQL database we would need to always drop the entire database and repopulate again, and it also helps that the MongoDB provides a very easy and python implementation to work with.
    \par Instead, for the Users' database we used an SQL one, and because we already knew what we wanted from the User, we knew we would use structured data for it.

    \subsubsection{Spark}
    \fpar For a posterior addition like it was with Spark we created a new microservice, this microservice would be responsible for both the Spark request we provide, this service receives the gRPC requests from the API Gateway and then processes them, creating job to send to the Google Cloud where we have a Cluster with the sole purpose of running these types of jobs.
