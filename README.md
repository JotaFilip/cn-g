# GROUP NUMBER 14

# Running
Using: `./scripts/run.sh` \ 
We build everything and start running:
1. Install Proto dependencies
2. Create Protobuf files
3. Populate Databases
4. Build Dockers
5. Run Dockers
6. Run Test

Notes: 
- Our databases are already populated, with something like 7 million rows of data
- With this test we only start up 4 microservices, so it doesn't take much time running
